# D-based Lisp/Haskell Interpreter Prototype

This repository contains a minimal prototype for a Lisp-style interpreter written in [D](https://dlang.org/). The project is inspired by [Axel](https://github.com/axellang/axel), which translates a Lisp dialect to Haskell. In this repository we show how D can be used to build similar tooling that targets an environment with limited system commands such as those described in the [`internetcomputer`](https://github.com/Jonathan-R-Anderson/internetcomputer) project.

The implementation is intentionally small and demonstrates how one might begin to build a cross compiler or interpreter that uses the D toolchain. The code is located in `src/interpreter.d`.

## Building

A D compiler such as `dmd` or `ldc2` is required. To cross compile for a specific target, supply the desired architecture flags to the compiler. For example:

```bash
ldc2 -mtriple=<target> src/interpreter.d -of=interpreter
```

Replace `<target>` with the appropriate triple for the operating system described in the `internetcomputer` repository.

## Usage

```
./interpreter "+ 1 2"  # prints 3
```

The interpreter now supports a broader set of commands:

- `echo` â€“ prints its arguments
- basic arithmetic with `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- variable assignment and expansion using `name=value` and `$name`
- directory commands like `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`
- Haskell-style `for` loops, e.g. `for 1..3 echo hi`
- concurrent commands using `&`, e.g. `echo one & echo two`
- sequential commands separated by `;`

Running the interpreter with no command argument starts an interactive shell.
You can customize the prompt text using the `PS1` environment variable and its
color with `PS_COLOR` (e.g. `PS_COLOR=green`). Type `exit` to leave the shell.

These examples demonstrate how additional Bash commands can be layered on top of a Haskell-inspired syntax. The goal remains to eventually cover the full Bash command set, including job control and other special operators.
